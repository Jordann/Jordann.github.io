MOM stands for "matter of moments". In short it is a time tracking tool which understands that you don't want 
to have to think about how to record your time, instead you want it to seize the moments of attention that you award it.

MOM is all about building operational software in new and sane way that will ready us for the growth of the application.

The goal is to create an application that is completely Decentralized. Seperating all our concerns creates 
an application that can grow well in the open source community. By using tools that can help us enforce this 
practice we hope to get a better understanding on creating apps that are very clear and readable by someone looking to contribute.


During the development I find that I am always learning new things and how to incorporate different frameworks and packages
into the work flow. Hopefully the app will be done soon to show off and get more people involved in the process!
