Just started this site to be used as a blog/portfolio web site. I decided to go with a static site generator of Jekyll.
This lets me use Markdown which is great. This makes adding posts and editing them very easy. Since im using github to version control 
my site I can easily add a blog post from any device.

I'm going to be adding to the design and updating the site throughout the next weeks, if you are interested about creating a static site 
and having it GitHub serve it up, I added a couple links below for you to get started.



Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].

Learn how to serve it up with [Github Pages][ghpages]
