I am a recent graduate at McMcaster in Computer Science, as well as a passionate developer with focus on using the browser
to it's fullest possibilities.



I always try to continually evolve my standards and practices and become a well-rounded developer.  
I push to follow concepts like MVC and try to maintain my code with great organization and readability.
